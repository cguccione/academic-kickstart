I am currently a second year PhD student in the Schwartz Lab and my main research interests include phylogenomics, bioinformatics, and genomics.

I've received my masters (Zoology) degree from Hacettepe University, Turkey. In my masters, I examined effects of climate change on the distribution patterns of certain vertebrate species including reptiles, birds and mammals, particularly in broad (Europe) and small (Anatolia) geographic scales. If interested, you can find my master’s thesis and publications through my Google Scholar link.

Nowadays, I am working on adaptive/rapid radiation patterns across bird clades. I use genomic data & reconstructed phylogenetic trees to understand adaptive radiation patterns. 

Besides writing code, I am a huge fan of outdoor activities such as camping, bird-watching, hiking, and climbing! Also I like to be active in academic & student organizations. I am currently Vice President of Graduate Student Association of University Rhode Island and active executive board member of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Society of Turkey.
